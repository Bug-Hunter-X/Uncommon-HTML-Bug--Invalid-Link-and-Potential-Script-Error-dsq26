This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug involving an invalid link and a script tag that might cause errors in some browsers.  The `bug.html` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.html` provides a corrected version. The script tag in the original html isn't harmful but it's always good practice to make sure your script has a proper purpose and is well-structured.
